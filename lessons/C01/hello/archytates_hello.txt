I grew up in West Tennessee in a small town called Dyersburg.
I attended college at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I majored in Latin and Ancient Greek.
I spent six months in Greece at the end of my undergrad.
I then began a PhD program in Classics at the University of North Carolina,
but after a year followed a professor to Cornell University where I 
finished my PhD in Classics and Indoeuropean Linguistics.
I then taught Latin for 14 years at the high school level before
beginning a career change in the MSDS program.
