I grew up in west Tennessee near Memphos.
I attended the Univ. of Tennessee in Knoxville.
I studied Latin and Ancient Greek language and literature.
I then pursued Classics and historical linguistics through
the PhD level at Cornell.
I have since taught primarily Latin at the high school level
for the past 14 years.
